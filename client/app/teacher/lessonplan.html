                Our objective in assembling this material was to provide you with a place to start.  Modify these lesson plans as you desire.
                The objective of the course is unique.
                In addition to mastering materials, we expect students to develop a personal financial, career and post secondary education plan,
                integrated with reality based math so they can achieve financial security.
                <p/>
                <p/>
                In accomplishing this major goal, they will have also achieved social and economic change for the state.

            <h3>General Class Procedures</h3>
            <h3>Time Required</h3>
            Each lesson is designed to start in one class period and either be completed in an hour or the remaining  lesson is to be assigned as work at home, assigned as team work after class or continued the next day if you are ahead of schedule. All presentations, important for student communication and development, take place in class.

            <h3>Materials</h3>
            Student workbook or students with computers access their materials online.
            <p/>
            Journals
            <p/>
            Internet access to video materials
            <p/>
            Speakers

            <h3>Procedure</h3>
            1.	The content of the lesson is appropriate for students of all academic achievement.
            <p/>
            2.	Treat the class as a business workplace. Students are expected to work and think both independently and in teams. Since this is probably a new experience for some of them, conduct after class or after school performance reviews of those struggling with work assignments.
            <p/>
            3.	Since students value money, explain that this course has the potential to pay them $1,000 per year while working and attending post secondary education.  Assuming at least two years of post-secondary education, the students would be earning a minimum of $12.12 / hour while attending this course, based on 165 class hours.  For others in the class, RLFM could save them more than $40,000 in college tuition and fees. In that case, the course is worth $245 / hour.  If money is not important to them, then their real goal should be to be financially independent and what they will learn in this course will help them achieve that goal too. For you the instructor, you too will benefit from this last goal.
            <p/>
            4.	As students enter the room, welcome them as you would employees and tell them their Do First activity is projected.
            <p/>
            5.	Do First consists of a video scribe to introduce the day’s lesson and then a song of your choice.  Students have until the end of the song to complete the Do First.
            <p/>
            6.	Following the Do First is a Vocabulary video, which introduces new words and concepts to be integrated into the lesson for the day.
            <p/>
            7.	Then the Essential SWBAT, where you discuss with students that these are their learning objectives.
            <p/>
            8.	Then Explore the Lesson, introduced by you.  You start by sharing with the students a personal real life example related to the Lesson. You can talk about you, family or friends (do not use their names). The objective is to bring real life to the lesson and make it relevant to their needs. The Lesson consists of subject matter expert videos, scripts, and/or reading assignments managed by you. These are provided so that instructors do not have to lecture.  They can challenge students’ understanding by questioning them and expecting them to think and understand.
            <p/>
            9.	After the Lesson the students work to Expand their knowledge with the materials to critically think and address higher order questions.  Expand often concludes with team presentations so you can hear if they have mastered the SWBAT and have a daily grade.

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            Complete your Prep Sheet explained in the Instructor Guide.
            <p/>

            The purpose of preparing for the journey is to meet the students where they currently are. Because they are from all different backgrounds, you should learn about each one of the students and their career aspirations. You can tell much about a person and his/her background just based on their goals.

            <h3>Quiz</h3>
            Once all of the unit lessons have been covered, have the students log into their QuizStar accounts in order to take their U 1 Quiz:
