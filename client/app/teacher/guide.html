            <p>Welcome to Real Life Financial Mathematics (RLFM).  This course is designed to prepare your students for a future; a future that is very different from your past.
Today 34% of the U.S. workforce is freelancing.  The societal and economic benefits of minimum wage, health and safety protections, workers comp, unemployment insurance and ease of tax withholding don’t exist for a large segment of our workforce.
In the past, folks lived in their homes 15 or 20 years, or more. Many paid off their mortgages and stayed in their homes well into their retirement. Today, the typical homeowner sells his or her home every five to seven years and the average individual will move 11.7 times during his or her lifetime.
</p>
<p>
By 2020, 65 percent of all jobs in the economy will require postsecondary education and training beyond high school. At the current production rate, the US will fall short of workers with post-secondary education by 5 million workers.
In the past, to achieve success you needed to work hard.  Today 62% of welfare recipients work either full or part time and 1/3 of American families are classified as working poor.
How do we introduce students to this future? RLFM provides you with a powerful tool for preparing your students for the future.
Should you have questions, please contact us at info@financialmentors.org.

            <p>In Real Life Financial Mathematics (RLFM) students step into the future and discover what is possible.  To facilitate their time travel, we have adapted the 6-E instructional model to RLFM. If you have not used a 5 or 6-E model, we encourage you to use it.  RLFM teachers have told us it allows them to be the type of teacher they have always wanted to be – free of lecturing, free of rote memorization exercises, free of small thinking tests -  and gives them the ability to focus on the students as stakeholders in education, asking students challenging questions and preparing them to think, analyze, communicate and lead.
</p>
<p>
RLFM is divided into units focused on a theme.  Each unit has lessons and the RLFM Lesson Plan offers recommendations on how you could teach the lesson.  Throughout the course, your role is a facilitator of learning - putting the students on the path to learn and discover new concepts. You do not need to lecture. Students will retain what they have learned by being actively involved in the process. To facilitate this learning process, each lesson follows a 6-E Lesson Plan.
</p>
<p>
You do though need to prepare.  Read the lesson and the course materials.  Each day, take a standard 8 1/2 x 11-inch sheet of paper.  Divide the sheets and place the labels in blue. Take notes, based on the recommendations below, throughout the class.

    <section class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading"><strong><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-th"></span> 6-E Lesson Plan</strong></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Why the 6-E Lesson Plan?  Unlike other course subjects – Math, Science, History - we expect students to come to the classroom with preconceptions, knowledge, beliefs and some skills regarding how the world works.  Many of these ideas are gained through parental nurturing, personal experience and from living in their communities.  Telling students their opinions right or wrong is not the best approach to real life education. Students should discuss the material and discover the answer that is right for them, and hopefully society.
</p>
<p>
Developing competence in any area, but especially in real life, requires a foundation of factual knowledge.  This knowledge is presented through subject matter experts, as scripts or videos and course materials.  Students understanding facts and ideas in the context of a conceptual framework.  The conceptual framework we use is teamwork, essays, partnering, presentations, higher order thinking questions and problem solving activities.
</p>
<p>
The students organize knowledge for retrieval and application.  Their success in mastering the expectations or TEKS (Texas Essential Knowledge & Skills) is demonstrate through their presentations, on-line quick tests and the experiential game played in class.  In the game, they apply the knowledge learned as they age from 19 to 26, while working, buying cars, insurance, real estate, filing tax returns, paying for college and other life events.
</p>
<p>
The 6th E – Essentials identifies the TEKS for that Unit and Lesson.  This encourages students to take responsibility and control of their learning.  The TEKS, presented as a SWBAT (Students Will Be Able To) defines the goals which must be mastered by the student..
</p>
            <ol>
               <li>ENGAGE – DO FIRST – As students enter the classroom they are engaged with an exercise to focus their attention on the day’s lesson, which is relevant to their future real life decisions.  DO FIRST exercises allow the students to step into the future and think about the home, car, job, benefits they would like to have and the person they would like to become.

DO FIRST exercises are videos set to music.  They are linked in the Power Point lesson. As the students enter the classroom they see the video and start working on the assignment.  When the video ends, you click on the music link and they have until the end of the song to finish the assignment.  The DO FIRST is approximately five minutes.  When the song is over, the DO FIRST is over. Some of the songs in the play list are:
•	What a Wonderful World
•	Eye of a Tiger
•	Ain’t No Mountain High Enough
•	Walking on Sunshine
•	Somewhere Over the Rainbow
•	Beautiful Day
•	Stand By Me
•	Don’t Worry, Be Happen
•	Imagine
•	Don’t Stop Believing
•	We’re Beautiful Like a Diamond in The Sky
•	Glory

               </li>
               <li>ESSENTIALS – Students then review the Vocabulary using the power point video and the TEK objectives, presented as SWBAT – Students Will Be Able To in a power point video. These three components focus clearly on what the student must master in each lesson.

Following this work, you have a few minutes for questions, comments and transitions into the lesson. Now is the time to ask the students questions to check for understanding and get them energized for the lesson. Be sure to watch the time.  If you miss your deadlines, it removes a sense of urgency and may lead the students to think that timed instructions are not serious expectations.</li>
               <li>EXPLORE – Lessons may be a Subject Matter Expert (SME) video lecture, a YouTube video, a reading assignment, a script (that you can video), a continuation of DO FIRST or an activity.  The lesson has two components critical for learning success.
♣	Instructors introduce the lesson by bringing personal experiences and relevancy of lesson to the students. You might say, “Today we will learn about Comprehensive Insurance.  Let me assure you, if your car is caught in 3 feet of water or stolen, you will want to know everything about this coverage.  Remember the last flodd.  Well one of my friends…….
♣	The lesson takes only 10-15 minutes.  The SME provides students consistent, objective, challenging, TEK directed, in depth professional content. SMEs offer school districts unbiased, objective, quality course materials in career, personal financial education and post-secondary education selection and funding.  Additionally, instructors feel confident in their ability to comprehensively address the scope of the lesson. At the conclusion of the lesson, you may ask the students “What questions do you have?  If you don’t understand a learning objective, ask for help.  Advocate for your needs.  Ask me, fellow students, volunteers, other teachers or your family.  Since this course is about real life, many people may be able to help you learn from their experiences.  They may also learn from your experiences.”
</li>
               <li>4.	EXPAND (or Explain)– Following The Lesson, students use critical thinking and problem solving skills to answer HOT-Q (higher order thinking questions). This may be done in teams, partners or in the class as a whole. You use Socratic methods to teach - answer questions with questions and acknowledge students with answers and challenge those who are not contributing. If working in teams, each team will have a spokesperson who will deliver the team’s response to the class. At first, class presentations may be awkward, but they will improve with practice.  During the presentations, all students are silent, attentive and take notes. Expect to use non-verbal directions to keep all students engaged. Following each presentation, class claps or finger snaps the presenter. This activity develops communication, critical thinking, and problem solving skills.

To facilitate team discussion, desks should be arranged to work in teams. Tape a colored index card (blue, green, yellow, pink, purple, or white) on the main team table. There is a blue team, green team, etc. Place a zip lock bag with classroom materials on each team table.

Where the lesson requires students to work in teams, as they enter the classroom, they are handed an index card with their team color and team assignment for the week.  Each 5-person team has a Leader, Reporter, Editor, Speaker and Scorekeeper. If using 4-person teams, Leader assumes responsibilities for Scorekeeper.

Students sit in teams. Cards are shuffled each week and handed to the students so they work with different teams and in different roles each week. If working in pairs, before class teacher writes on white board the pairing - blue and green Leader pair, blue and green Reporter pair, blue and green Speaker, etc. Students can sit where you direct them to sit.
</li>
               <li>4.	ELABORATE - Students then reflect and expand with independent “Why is this relevant to me?” activities.  They may be asked to write about their thoughts in a Journal (online or traditional), create a 10-year road map for their future integrating academic, personal, career and financial goals, meeting with volunteers to calibrate their ideas to reality or use social media to share what they have learned wit friends, family and the community.

                       <div class="col-md-6">
                           4.	EVALUATE - After all the lessons in the unit are complete, students assess if they mastered the lesson’s ESSENTIALS.  We recommend periodic assessments, in the form of an exit survey or quiz to confirm if your students 1) believe they achieved their objectives and 2) accurately answered a HOTQ from the chapters taught during the week.  This exit survey can be taken on a paper, or on the internet using a computer or cell phone, if you have a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy.  One phone can be used for multiple students.
In the lesson plan and power point we will provide you with a link to tests that have been created  
Online quiz providers do not grade essay questions or provide for essay questions.  Where we believe an essay is necessary to determine the student’s level of understanding, we have included the essays in the lesson plan.  You may print and distribute the lesson to students and grade answers after class.  All essays have the students use 150 characters to answer their essay.  If students are using Word to answer the essay, they can use the character count tool.

Raised Hand – I need your attention. Students respond by each raising a hand and paying attention.
Finger Snaps or Rhythm Claps – Recognizing performance
Student hand in air with 1, 2 or 3 fingers raised – When teacher asks, how much more time do you need, student indicates by raising hand with 1, 2 or 3 fingers representing minutes needed to complete an assignment.

        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Collaboration is teams is important for student success in RLFM and in real life as a contributor to the knowledge economy of the 21st century.  Students need to learn how to play on teams focused on problem solving and critical thinking.  Almost every lesson provides an opportunity for the students to embrace diversity, communication, thinking and answer HOTQs.
Instructors find this section the most challenging and rewarding.
As students enter the classroom they are given a colored index card with a team roll on it. See 6-E Lesson, the 4th E for explanation of team design.
Let’s talk teams:  Hopefully you will develop your students as critical thinkers.  In most classes, even through college, so much focus is on acquisition of the who, what, when, where knowledge.  Emphasis on the how and why knowledge is often neglected.   In RLFM the students must learn how to think and dig deeper to understand what is happening and why.  This is what takes RLFM from financial literacy to a financial knowledge course.
If confused about the difference between literacy and knowledge, think about the difference between a person who is literate versus one who possesses knowledge.  A major difference.  We want our students to question, even come up with the wrong answers, and ultimately discover they were wrong.
You are the catalyst for this level of learning.
Warning – be patient.  In our summer 8-hour a day classes, it takes until day two before the students get comfortable with communicating, asking questions, contributing and thinking.  But ultimately you should hear them say, “I love thinking!” followed by “My head hurts.”  In the past, during the course, the average student advanced their critical thinking by three years.
If you want some implementation ideas, you can always email the course creator, me – Lorraine Decker – at Lorraine@FinancialMentors.org.
I also recommend you watch the following YouTube videos, which have shaped our course structure and student expectations.

        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>RLFM uses the Internet for accessing songs, videos, quizzes, Internet and course materials.  These links are referenced in the Lesson Plan.  RLFM assumes all registered instructors have access to a computer and the Internet.  Instructors will access the RLFM dashboard and navigate the dashboard to view all course material.  Instructors can share dashboard materials with the students through projection equipment.  Instructors will need audio speakers.
</p>
<p>
If an instructor is absent and wants a substitute teacher to conduct the class, the substitute must have the instructor’s password and email address to access the dashboard.
</p>
<p>
The following are access options for your student.
•	On the internet dashboard is a student workbook.  You may print one for each registered student.  Students should take notes in their workbook or Journal.
•	If a student drops the course, and a new student registers for the class, you have the option of giving the new student the used workbook units or printing fresh unit copies.  If you print fresh prior class covered material for the new student, your district will be charge $10 for each substitute student. You may print as many units as are needed. Your district is not charged an additional licensing fee since you are substituting students.
</p>
<p>
All students must be registered.  You may not make multiple copies of any printed document.
Relative to taking notes, students are authorized to write in the workbooks or they may use a standard composition notebook to brainstorm, take notes, edit documents and write “finished” product in their composition book or worksheets you create for the activities and essays. You decide what you want the students to do.
As students gain access to technology (in school, at home) you may ask them to use different tools to complete your class material.
</p>
<p>
MORE FEATURES!
WORD TO THE WISE – These elements of sage advice are in red boxes, heading the left column.  The focus of the quote is integrated in the lesson content for the day.  The quotes are always good WOW statements for the students to repeat aloud together, explain and then memorize.
</p>
<p>
DAILY GRADES – Several easy options:
•	Opportunity to grade DO FIRST assignments and activities.
•	When the students are working in teams, the scorekeeper for each team will announce the points sequentially awarded to the other teams.  Scorekeeper also explains why his team is awarding 5 points to a team. Teacher can add up the points, ranging from 5 to 1 and that can serve as your daily grade for the students. Realize that grading sequentially will require you to make grade adjustments since only 60% of the teams will actually pass and 40% will fail with an award of 1 or 2 points.  You may want to explain that this happens in real life.  Business is cyclical and often the individuals with the lower performance evaluations are laid off or terminated.
•	You can use the above as an indicator and give your own score based on how you believe the students have mastered the objectives.
•	Students will have reflected work in their Journal, contained in their Notebooks. You can review these assignments and grade.
•	Test scores from the Unit Exit Survey.
</p>
<p>
ANSWERS to QUESTIONS – Rarely does the curriculum ask a question with an obvious answer.  Therefore, in each lesson plan, we provide the instructor with the type of answer we seek from the student.  Your objective is to try to steer the students, teams, and class in the direction of the desired response so they evolve the answer through thinking.  Teens embrace ideas and concepts when they have discovered them.  If you tell them the answer, it is YOUR answer, not THEIR answer.
</p>
<p>
CRITICAL THINKING assignments are out of class opportunities for students to expand and apply their knowledge.  These assignments will indicate if the student must work alone or may work in teams.  The assignments have a suggested deadline. The objective of these assignments is to make students life long learners and encourage them to think.

            TEXAS TEKS §130.180. Financial Mathematics - One Credit, Adopted 2015
                and Real Life Financial Mathematics
            <p/>
                (a)  General requirements. This course is recommended for students in Grades 10-12. Prerequisite: Algebra I. This course satisfies a high school mathematics graduation requirement. Students shall be awarded one credit for successful completion of this course.
            <p/>
                (b)  Introduction.
            <p/>
                (1)  Career and technical education instruction provides content aligned with challenging academic standards and relevant technical knowledge and skills for students to further their education and succeed in current or emerging professions.
            <p/>
                (2)  The Finance Career Cluster focuses on planning, services for financial and investment planning, banking, insurance, and business financial management.
            <p/>
                (3)  Financial Mathematics is a course about personal money management. Students will apply critical-thinking skills to analyze personal financial decisions based on current and projected economic factors.
            <p/>
                (4)  Financial Mathematics will integrate career and postsecondary education planning into financial decision making.
            <p/>
                (5)  The mathematical process standards describe ways in which students are expected to engage in the content. The placement of the process standards at the beginning of the knowledge and skills listed for each grade and course is intentional. The process standards weave the other knowledge and skills together so that students may be successful problem solvers and use mathematics efficiently and effectively in daily life. The process standards are integrated at every grade level and course. When possible, students will apply mathematics to problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. Students will use a problem-solving model that incorporates analyzing given information, formulating a plan or strategy, determining a solution, justifying the solution, and evaluating the problem-solving process and the reasonableness of the solution. Students will select appropriate tools such as real objects, manipulatives, paper and pencil, and technology and techniques such as mental math, estimation, and number sense to solve problems. Students will effectively communicate mathematical ideas, reasoning, and their implications using multiple representations such as symbols, diagrams, graphs, and language. Students will use mathematical relationships to generate solutions and make connections and predictions. Students will analyze mathematical relationships to connect and communicate mathematical ideas. Students will display, explain, or justify mathematical ideas and arguments using precise mathematical language in written or oral communication.
            <p/>
                (6)  Students are encouraged to participate in extended learning experiences such as career and technical student organizations and other leadership or extracurricular organizations.
            <p/>
                (7)  Statements that contain the word "including" reference content that must be mastered, while those containing the phrase "such as" are intended as possible illustrative examples
